sd-base
=======

A template Dockerfile compatible with the `spin-docker PaaS <https://github.com/atbaker/spin-docker>`_.

This Dockerfile does not compile to a functioning Docker image, but it is a good template to use when you're building your own spin-docker compatible images.

Read the `Creating your own spin-docker images <http://spin-docker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/creating_sd_images.html>`_ section of the spin-docker documentation for more information.
